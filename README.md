# binpackingsim
Quick script to simulate different online [bin packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing) strategies (e.g. for writeable [union-mounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_mount) systems like [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) or [mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs))

It's very WIP so parameters are hardcoded for the moment. Tk GUI coming eventually
